# VBA-Challenge
## Overview of the Project
Refactoring the code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect information.
## Results
* Refactored code and measured performance.
* Run the Stock Analysis successfully for 2017 and 2018.
* The returns for 2017 are greater than 2018.
## Summary
* Refactoring doesn't add new fuctionality to the code, rather it makes the code more efficient.
* Refactoring makes the code fresher, usues less memory and improves the logic of the code to make future users easier to work with.
* On the other hand, its very time consuming and cannot work on a limited time frame.
* It may even put the programer in a deadend.
